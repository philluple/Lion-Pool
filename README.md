# Lion Pool

This is a project that I started working on during the summer out of boredom and wanting to try exploring front-end design, Swift, and FireBase API. Lion Pool is an idea that I had because as a student that lives out of state, when I do go home, the trip to and from the airport feels longer and takes more logistics than the actual flight. It is really difficult to navigate public transportation to the airport but it is also super expensive to use ride share services. My inspiration came from the solution to all this, doing all of this with someone else. However, another problem: my friends never travelled at the same time as me or the same airport! 

**This is LionPool**, an app that allows you to match with other Columbia students who are going to the same airport at the same time, therefore, allowing coordination between both parties to travel to the airport together. However, with expanded use this idea can be used for travelling all over the city. 

## Beginning Stages (Figma) 

I loved this stage. I put a lot of thought into the colors and font that I made very deliberate choices based on research that I did in color theory and font accessibility. Here is a screenshot below of my work:
