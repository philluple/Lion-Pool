# Lion Pool

This is a personal project. One that I did not expect would take so much time, be so hard, but still learn so much from. Lion Pool is an idea that I had because as a student who lives out of state, when I do go home, the trip to and from the airport feels longer and takes more logistics than the actual flight. It isn't easy to navigate public transportation to the airport but it is also super expensive to use ride-share services. Now, my solution is to do all of this with someone else. 

**This is LionPool**, an app that allows you to match with other Columbia students who are going to the same airport at the same time, therefore, allowing coordination between both parties to travel to the airport together. However, with expanded use, this idea can be used for traveling all over the city.
