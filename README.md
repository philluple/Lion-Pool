# Lion Pool

This is a personal project. One that I did not expect would take so much time, be so hard, but still learn so much from. Lion Pool is an idea that I had because as a student who lives out of state, when I do go home, the trip to and from the airport feels longer and takes more logistics than the actual flight. It isn't easy to navigate public transportation to the airport but it is also super expensive to use ride-share services. Now, my solution is to do all of this with someone else. 

**This is LionPool**, an app that allows you to match with other Columbia students who are going to the same airport at the same time, therefore, allowing coordination between both parties to travel to the airport together. However, with expanded use, this idea can be used for traveling all over the city. 

## Beginning Stages (Figma) 

I really enjoyed this part of the process, I am a very pro-Figma user. I put a lot of thought into the colors and font that I made very deliberate choices with the fonts and colors. I obviously based the colors on Columbia, so lots of different variations of blue accented with some yellow for buttons and important messages. I also decided to go with Apple's standard font, SF Pro, because I liked how the app felt very integrated with my iPhone. However, I did not begin considering Android users. Here is a [link](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1208809327994709224), and below is a screenshot of my Figma prototype:

## Using XCode

I built a dynamic front end using Swift and SwiftUi. I used different View Models that help me seperate
